Tracks overall sales and profit trends.

Highlights top-performing products and customers.

Compares sales across categories and regions.

Measures customer loyalty with repeat purchase metrics.

• Business Impact & Insights

📈 Customer Loyalty: With a repeat purchase rate of 99.5%, the store has an extremely loyal customer base—providing a strong foundation for upselling and cross-selling strategies.

💰 Profitability Check: Despite high sales, total profit is relatively low (11K), suggesting thin margins or high costs.

🛒 Product Insights: One product (Canon imageCLASS 2200) dominates sales, creating dependency risk. Diversifying best-sellers is crucial.

🌍 Regional Strategy: Technology sells strongly in all regions, but Furniture and Office Supplies are more region-specific—indicating tailored marketing opportunities.

👤 Customer Value: A small set of customers (Top 5) contribute significantly to sales. Building deeper relationships with these customers could yield higher returns.
